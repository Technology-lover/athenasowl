<h1>What is dark web ?</h1>

<p>The dark web is the hidden part of the internet that contains material, information and web pages that are not indexed in any of the existing search engines such Google. So in the hypothetical case that search engines could index the entire content on the web would mean that the dark web would disappear.</p>

<p>If we make an analogy with the movie matrix, we could say that the totality of people who take the blue pill would be the people who only navigate and know what we call the superficial network while the totality of people who would take the red pill are the people who would know the existence of the dark web.</p>

<p>96% of the Internet is not accessible through standard search engines. You can find everything there. Some examples</p>
<ul>
  <ol>
    
<li>Hacked social media accounts</li>
    <img src="/accohack.jpg"/>
    
<li>Stealed ATM cards</li>

<li>Buying drugs</li>

<li>Weapons,Hitman services</li>

<li>Stealed electronics</li>

</ul>

<p>These methods are what prevent web pages from being indexed by traditional search engines:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Web Archives:</b> Allow users to view archived versions of web pages over time, not indexed by search engines.</li>
  <li><b>Contextual Web:</b> Pages with different content for different access contexts.</li>
  <li><b>Dynamic content:</b> Dynamic pages that return a response to a submitted question or access through a form, especially if input elements are used in the open domain as text fields.</li>
  <li><b>Non-HTML content:</b> Textual content in multimedia files, other extensions such as exe, rar, zip, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Limited access content:</b> These are sites that limit access to your pages in a technical way (for example, using the robot exclusion standard or captcha, which forbids search engines from navigating and creating cached copies.</li>
  <li><b>Private Web:</b> Sites that require registration and login (password-protected resources).</li>
  <li><b>Software:</b> Hidden sites of the superficial web, accessible only with special software like Tor, I2P or other software, for example Tor only allows users to access websites using the .onion server address anonymously by hiding their IP address.</li>
</ol>

<h1>How big is dark web?</h1>

<p><br/>According to data from Wikipedia in the year 2000, superficial Internet had a size of 167 Terabytes, while the dark Web had a size of 7500 Terabytes, which means that the content of the dark web was 45 times greater than the information to which we had access. <br/>That moment. Currently, the University of California at Berkeley estimates that the actual size of the dark network is <b>91,000 Terabytes</b>.</p>

<h1>What can we find in the dark web?</h1>

<p><br/>Not all the contents of the dark web are illegal. We can find interesting and diverse content such as:
